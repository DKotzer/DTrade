<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## General Overview :bar_chart:

DCrypto is a practice trading app, or game, to practice/play at trading cryptocurrencies.
Every new account starts with 10,000 dollars USD of practice money and can buy/sell cryptocurrencies based on the current price on the Kraken trading platform.
Have you ever wanted to experience the fun of trading crypto without the risk of losing your money? Now is your chance.

You can visit the site and start trading by clicking [here].

## About The Project

For my second project at my software engineering bootcamp I am making a practice trade site for trading cryptocurrencies.
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our newly learned skills from unit 2: Node, Express, Mongoose, APIs and CRUD in comination with skills learned in unit 1: CSS, HTML, JavaScript.

## Built With:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Icebox :icecream:

See the [open issues](https://github.com/DKotzer/DTrade/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Original Plan

Original wireframe images, I did replicate the wire frame at first but it looked very amateurish so I completely changed it to focus around the charts and a darker theme.
