## General Overview :bar_chart:

DCrypto is a practice trading app, or game, to practice/play at trading cryptocurrencies.
Every new account starts with 10,000 dollars USD of practice money and can buy/sell cryptocurrencies based on the current price on the Kraken trading platform.
Have you ever wanted to experience the fun of trading crypto without the risk of losing your money? Now is your chance.

You can visit the site and start trading by clicking [here].

Before using the site you must first make an account and then log in. You can navigate using the main Navigation Bar at the top and can also log out from there.

## About The Project

For my second project at my software engineering bootcamp I am making a practice trade site for trading cryptocurrencies.
The purpose of the project is to demonstrate our newly learned skills from unit 2: Node, Express, Mongoose, APIs and CRUD in comination with skills learned in unit 1: CSS, HTML, JavaScript.

## Built With:

- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS

## Icebox :icecream:

- Fix the multiple .save() bug properly instead of current workaround.
- Implement a working datalist for the buy symbol input to autosuggest symbols based on input.
- Add user first names to chat instead of anon.
- Allow various sorting of the account summary page by clicking the headings.
- Display crypto news in the bottom left of buy/sell pages
- Account page with some options, light/dark mode, profile picture
- Allow user to delete account from account page
- Allow user to create multiple trade accounts from account page
- Allow to view history of individual cryptos by clicking it from history page

See the [open issues](https://github.com/DKotzer/DTrade/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Original Plan

Original wireframe images, I did replicate the wire frame at first but it looked really bad so I completely changed it to focus around the charts and a darker theme.
